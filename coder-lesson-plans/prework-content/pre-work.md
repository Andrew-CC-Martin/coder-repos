- 

# Planning

## Questions

- Use github profile readme, or just a repo?
- should I create a video (but *only* after the written content is finalised)?

## Tips

- pinpoint the problem
- define what success looks like
- decide the format (where am I gonna put this damn thing?)
- make it user-friendly (lots of images, dot points, white space)

## markdown ex. Overview

- set up github account
  - every developer needs one
- create profile readme
  - your first experience coding
  - makes your github more interesting and attention-grabbing

# Content

The first thing we're going to do is set up our accounts on github. Navigate to https://github.com/ and create a new account. Your username is going to be part of your personal brand as a developer, so choose it wisely! Something based on your own name is recommended but not necessary.
