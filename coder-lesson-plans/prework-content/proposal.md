# proposal for pre-work content


## 1. Create an about me page on github, using markdown

### Activity overview

Students will create a github account (if they don't already have one), 
and create an 'about me' markdown file that will be used to
introduce themselves.

### Purpose/value of activity

- using markdown gives a soft intro to 'coding'
- students get github accounts up and running
- creating an 'about me' page gives some material for an icebreaker during orientation

## Possible Extras

- Typing skills (my personal recommend is https://www.typingclub.com/)
- OS shortcut keys
  - mac https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/macbook-air/apd194062a6d/mac
  - windows https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec
- arithmetic overview
  - give a refresher on basic arithmetic, to ensure students can do things such 
as dealing with negative numbers
