# Lesson planning

### General

- Lesson plan needs two parts:
  - actual plan
  - code itself (can sometimes live without this, but having done a dry run is preferable)

- The async delivery method sets the stage perfectly for using the “flipped classroom” model, where lecture-type content is done on student’s own time, and classroom time is mostly used for stuff like problem-solving, debate, presentations

### Content

- Code along should mostly use stuff they've already learned, but doesn't need to use everything.

- Be sure to cover everything that is mentioned in the marking rubrics for the coding assessments.

# Time management

- Go to office after lectures. Use most of afternoons and Saturdays for lesson planning. Lean heavily on Cat - she can do the bulk of direct assistance.

- Plan code alongs for min 2 days, and possibly more.

- Specify working days and availability. Maintain clear boundaries.

- Encourage students to post their issues onto public discord channels

- Encourage students to ask each other for help, and to help other people

# General Teaching skills and pedagogy

- need to have more emphasis on the 'golden thread'
- What's our plan and objective for the day
- How does each thing we are doing relate to that objective

Some extra strategies
- Get students and/or Cat to tell me when I'm off track
- Daily plan on BBB whiteboard

### Explicit Instruction

- Before the lesson, identify the objective. Make it clear and specific.

- Model with clear explanations

- explain or demonstrate skill in the same way that students will use it

- Use language that is clear, concise, and consistent

- Focus on most critical areas

- Verbalise the thought process

- Give a verbal stream of thought. What am I doing, why am I doing it?

- Ideally, script this beforehand. Especially for tricky stuff

- Provide opportunities to practice

- Give feedback

### Motivation and Engagement

- Use fun activities at start of lesson to spark engagement. Eg:

  - kahoots or other games

  - simulations

- Don’t describe things as “easy”, “trivial”, “simple”, “straightforward” etc. Someone is always going to be confused/struggling.


### Misc

- Always portray confidence. Cool, calm, collected, in control.

# Coder/flex-track specific

- At the start of the lesson, ask what students learned from their async study

- Follow the syllabus and async content. Try not to deviate, ie do it in order, use same terminology etc.

- Go deep on the 'why'. The async content covers the what/how

- Minimise unnecessary jargon. Remember that people won’t be familiar with terms such as “syntax”

- Expectations to set/emphasise:

  - Do the async content before sync days

  - It will get intense. Be ready.

  - Be consistent in effort. Maintain self-care, but also be ready to make sacrifices.

  - Help each other. Post questions in discord channels. Group work and pair programming are highly encouraged, because of both learning value and industry relevance

  - Use google, read the docs. This is what being a developer is all about.

  - Don’t get discouraged or stressed by errors and bugs. It’s all part of the process. Keep calm and carry on.

# Topic-specific

- Object-oriented programming

  - Confusion about class vs class instance. Use metaphor of blueprint vs actual house

- Command-line

  - What is it? Be clear that this is just a different way of accessing the same underlying operating system.

  - What’s the point. Explain how this is more flexible and productive once you’ ve got the hang of it. Also mention that there are other advantages, but don’t go into them too much (eg ssh)
