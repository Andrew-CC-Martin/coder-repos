# Stuff to address with Alex B

- A little concerned about the content being too advanced/esoteric
  - how did fastrack go with it?
  - eg deep diving on closures in wk1
  - could be nice to mark certain sections as 'advanced' and/or 'extra'

- feel like students will get restless waiting for DOM manipulation in wk3
