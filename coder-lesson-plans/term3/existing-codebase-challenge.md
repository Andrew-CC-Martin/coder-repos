- find a simple, open source react codebase for the students to work on
- explain how creating a new project, like we've been doing, is quite different from working on a large, existing codebase
- so, I want to give you all an opportunity to work on something a bit more real-world relevant

## Pair exercise

- each need to build totally separate features, then
- each need to review each other's code
