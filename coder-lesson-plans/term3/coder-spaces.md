1. What should the spaces be called?

2. What colour should the walls be?

3. What should the chairs/desks look like?
- I don't see any big problem with the existing desks and chairs. Though a couple of yoga balls would be nice as chair alternatives (plus they're dirt cheap).

4. How should the room be arranged?
- Fun stuff like beanbags etc around the back/sides of the room. Desks in the middle, arranged either "blocks" or a horseshoe shape rather than the current "American style classroom" with individual desks. This encourages interaction and collaboration

5. What should be in the room besides standard teaching tools (teacher's desk etc)?
- Beanbags & a couch (with cushions)
- Indoor plants would be very nice (if someone is willing to water them)
- Another nice to have would be a shelf full of toys and fun stuff eg board games, rubic's cubes, fidget spinner, adult colouring books, etc (this wouldn't need to be expensive, we could potentially grab a lot of this from op shops)
  - Give the students something to distract/soothe them when they're bored/stressed
  - Good ice breaker and encourages social interaction
  - Encourages a playful and creative vibe
  - Ideally the shelf would also have a few carefully selected programming books eg "clean code", "Pragmatic programmer", etc
- Could also be fun to have a strip of astroturf for the couches and/or beanbags to sit on. Would make the space look funky, and feel a little more cozy.

6. What sort of images should be in the room (if any)?
- Artwork on the walls would be great. Maybe some kind of mural?

7. What should the lighting be like?
- Instead of fluorscent tubes with harsh white light, we should use a "warmer" tone

9. What wifi/IT requirements would be bottom-line needs? What would be the next step up? 
- Wifi in C17 is a bit of a dead spot, would be good to address that.

10. What would the teacher's space in the classrooms need?

11. Are there any other ideas/necessary tools for the room?
- First and foremost: every desk needs to have a power supply. This could be done easily/affordably by hanging industrial-style power supplies from the ceiling
- Currently the heating/air con situation is not ideal. The temp is extremely inconsistent across campus, with upstairs generally being very hot, and the classrooms at the other end of the building are often very cold.
- More whiteboards would be nice. The one at the front of the classroom feels too much like it belongs to the teacher only, and are rarely used by the students. Having them at the sides and/or back of the room would encourage the students to do more whiteboarding.

12. Please attach any images of spaces/rooms that you think really capture the vibe.
